# Revolutionary-War-Game
This is the first game I ever made that was serious; It was for a history project. I am currently 13 years old. I only had a month to make this. These are the files for the WebGL version of the game. If you want to play it without downloading, use this link:

Here is the actual app download: https://gavinkai.itch.io/revolution-download?secret=hvUhWwpsKTveWPhv82dd7CHjfiI

The game is VERY buggy and slow since it was my first game and I had huge time restraints when making it. I still consider it impressive because of the speed I made it at and the fact that it was my first game/app.

On mac, since I am not a certified developer, you may run into some problems during download. Here's a tutorial on how to override the developer block just in case you really want to play my game: https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-app-unidentified-developer-3669596/#:~:text=Go%20to%20Security%20%26%20Privacy%20and,Open%20will%20run%20the%20app.

If you don't want to go through the hassle of downloading the app, check out this WebGL game link: https://gavinkai.itch.io/my-history-project
